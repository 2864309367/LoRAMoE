The dependent clause in a complex sentence usually begins with a subordinating conjunction or relative pronoun. Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, or whose.\nIf she ever gets the chance, Terri would love to visit the Egyptian pyramids.\nDuring his trip to Italy, Tony visited the Trevi Fountain, which is in Rome.\nA compound-complex sentence is made up of two or more independent clauses and one or more dependent clauses.\nAfter Samantha left work, she stopped at the bank, and then she went to the gym.\nSometimes a dependent clause in a complex or compound-complex sentence can interrupt an independent clause.\nOrcas that are kept in captivity often have bent dorsal fins.",

How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?\nFirst, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.\nNext, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.\nSo, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!",
